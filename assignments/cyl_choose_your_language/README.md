# Assignment: Choose a Language

Choose an appropriate language to use in this class.  Along with others who choose your language, contribute the following to the course wiki:

* A description and background of your language.  How did it start?  What is it primarily used for?  How popular is it?  What are its strengths and weaknesses?
* An explanation (with examples) of how your programming language manages memory, the call/frame stack, bytecode instructions, etc.  Include information about the stack, heap, pointers and/or references, and garbage collection.

While others in the class will also contribute to your wiki page, you need to author at least one coding example linked to the language page.  Ensure the example is clear and concise, but ensure it is complex enough to illustrate something about the inner workings of your language.  Walk the reader through the development of your program, and show output data.

The following steps will help you get started:

1. Go to [http://www.bitbucket.com/](BitBucket) and create an account.
1. Ensure `git` works in your terminal (console/command prompt/shell/powershell).  If not, you need to [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git](install git).  There are graphical front ends, but I highly recommend you learn the terminal commands this semester.
1. Create a directory where you'll keep the files for this course.  We'll call it `byu537`.
1. In terminal, change to the `byu537` directory. Clone the class git repository: `git clone git@bitbucket.org:jdt1204/byu_data_structures.git`.  You should now have a new directory called `byu_data_structures`.  This is where assignments will be posted.
1. In terminal, change to the `byu538` directory. Clone the class git **wiki** repository: `git clone git@bitbucket.org:jdt1204/byu_data_structures.git/wiki`.  You should now have a new directory called `wiki`.  This is where you can edit the wiki pages.

Next, learn how to write markdown by going [https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/markdown-syntax-guide-776639995.html](a documentation page).  It's pretty easy to pick up. 

Finally, add information about your language to the wiki pages. 

1. In terminal, Change to the `byu537/wiki` directory.
1. Pull all new changes: `git pull`.  There probably won't be any since you just cloned the repository, but it's good practice.
1. Create a branch to work in: `git checkout -b 08_30
