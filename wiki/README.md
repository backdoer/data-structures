# Welcome to the Data Structures Wiki

Here is where we'll be creating our own Data Structures / Algorithms knowledge base. Here's how to use it: 

## Wiki How-To

This wiki uses the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax. So, you'll create files using the in-browser editor and write text files in the Markdown syntax. If you're not familiar with Markdown, take some time and familiarize yourself with some of the basics, like Headers, links, and lists. It's pretty easy to pick up. 

If you so desire, the wiki itself is actually a git repository, which means you can clone it, edit it locally/offline, add images or any other file type, and push it back to us. It will be live immediately. You use the following command to clone it to your machine: 

```
$ git clone https://jdt1204@bitbucket.org/jdt1204/byu_data_structures.git/wiki
```

But, the BitBucket in-browser editor (which you can get by clicking on the `Edit` or `Create Wiki Page` buttons) is plenty to create and edit your pages. 

## Syntax highlighting

Since Markdown allows for easy syntax highlighting for pretty much any language that you'll be using, **PLEASE USE THIS FEATURE**! Here's an example of how to do just that: 

```python

def foo(bar):

   return bar

```

(Click the "Edit" button at the top right to see the source for the code above.)

## Using the Wiki for this Class

To use this Wiki for the class's purposes, follow this general workflow: 

1. Write your Wiki entry locally on your machine in a `.md` file. 
2. Edit this document and add a link to either the Data Structures or Algorithms sections below (you can look below for syntax on how to do that). 
3. Save this page
4. Click on the link
5. It will take you to a blank page since you haven't actually created the page yet
6. Click the button than says something like "Create This Page"
7. **At this point the BitBucket editor won't load properly.** Don't worry, that's just a bug on BitBucket's side of things. Just click the "Save" button, and the page will be refreshed with the full editor. 
8. Paste in the contents of your Wiki entry and save it

## Language Choices

Create a document for your language choices, and add it to this list (this is referencing the "Choose your Language" assignment in Learning Suite): 

- [Python](Python_Choose_Language_Assignment.md)
- [Python](Everything_Python.md)
- [Swift](Swift_Choose_Language_Assignment.md)
