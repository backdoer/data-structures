This page is all about the awesome scripting language known as PHP.

PHP is a scripting language that can be used for a variety of purposes. It is commonly used in web applications (either standalone or in those build on Drupal, Wordpress, etc.) to do dynamic processing on the server side. Because PHP is a server-side language, the client (browser) cannot view the actual script that generated the output - only the output (or result) of the script is visible on the client side. However, PHP has [more use cases](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatcando.php) than just web development.

PHP's name is a recursive acronym that stands for PHP: Hypertext Processor.
