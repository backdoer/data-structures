# Welcome to Data Structures - Fall 2016

This repo is here to house all of your assessments that you will write. Also, this is where you'll be able to post your Wiki articles that are assigned in class. This is **NOT** where you will be turning in your assignment attempts. In other words, this is where you'll post the assessment that you have to create. You'll send the assessments that you actually solve directly to John (more on how you'll do that later...) 

## General Repo Conduct

This repo is a private repository, meaning that you have to be explicitly added as a contributor to see it. That being said, all contributors will be able to see the branches that you create. **For this reason, do not include the answer key to the assignments that you write in your branches that you push up.** Also, don't mess around on other branches. It's Git, so we'll have a log of who's acting the fool. 

The general class workflow will go as follows: 

1. Clone this repo to your computer (`git clone...`)
2. Create a branch titled `algorithm_name` (or `data_structure_name`) **off of master**
3. Write your assignment in a file in the project root by adding a `*.py` or `*.java`... 
4. Add, commit, and push your branch up to the repo
5. DM John in Slack to let him know that you've finished, and he'll go in and review your work. When it's been graded, he'll merge it into `master`. 

## Adding to the Wiki

You'll notice a Wiki on the left navigation menu. BitBucket's wiki is just a series of Markdown files. Feel free to add in a Wiki article, and link to it by editing the Wiki's main page **where it's indicated to edit it**. You can do all of this with the in-browser tools. 

### Note

Git tracks changes to the Markdown files and keeps records of the different commits... So please don't mess around on anyone else's Wiki articles. 

## Wrapping Up

If you have any questions about using any of the class tools or repos or anything, feel free to DM John (`@johnt`) in the IS Slack team. 

Doing class this way is meant to be a little different, and quite open. So, please don't abuse us using BitBucket for assignments. If everything works out the way that it should, at the end of the class, we'll have a nice project folder full of different algorithm assignments, keys, and a nice, beefy Wiki you can reference later.
